![](/images/salary.png)

### Project Overview
- Created a model that estimates the salary for a job in data (data science,data analysis,MLE, etc)
- Exploratory analysis of the data to find patterns and get insights
- Visualisation of the said patterns and insights
- Tested on Linear, Lasso and Random Forest Regressor. Used GridSearchCV to optimize our best model

### Conclusion
##### Key Insights from EDA
- Python is as key programming software for a person looking to work in the field of Data Science or any other data related roles.
- People with Python and Machine Learning skills stand a good chance of earning an above average to a every good salary.
- California, DC and New York came out as the best locations overall taking into account the number of openings and the estimated salary.
- Low to low-mid tier companies seem to be hiring a high number of people in data related jobs whereas the public companies are the ones giving out the highest salaries


## [Project 2: Who is the best winger in the English Premier League?](https://github.com/WasiShaikh977/PL-Wingers-Weighted-index)

### Project Overview

In modern football, tons of different metrics are used to determing how well a player does in certain aspects of the game. Goals, shots on target, goal conversion rate, etc show you how good a player is at scoring goals for his team. Whereas other stats like key passes, assists, through passes, cross completion percentage, etc point towards how good a player is at creating chances for her teammates. Hundreds of KPIs (Key point indicators) are used by modern football analysts and data scientists to objectify a player's performance.

In this project, we will handpick 21 of these KPIs and use statistical modelling techniques to mesh all of them together into 1 metric. This is the Wingers Weigthted index. The higher the index, the better the player. We will create 4 such indexes (All rounder, Goalscorer, Creator, Dribbler). Different weights will be given to different metrics for the various indexes.
- All Rounder index: Equally distributed weights as per a winger's requirements
- Goalscorer index: More importance given to goalscoring metrics
- Creator index: More importance given to chance creation metrics
- Dribbler index: More importance given to dribbling metrics

### Key Findings
- Statistically speaking, Mohamed Salah has been the best winger in the Premier League for the past 3 seasons. This is also backed by the general fan sentiment and the mainstream football opinion.
- The next 3 in the list are all Manchester City players. No surprise here as City have dominated the Premier League and have one of the best goalscoring output not just in the league but also across Europe.
- Phil Foden and Gabriel Martinelli are the only current U23 players to make the top 10 in the overall rankings.
- Michael Olise ranked 3rd among the best U24 wingers over the last 3 seasons. Olise and Neto were the only 2 players who played for a non-top 6 club and finished in the top 10 (for U24s).
- Statistically, Gabriel Martinelli was the best U23 winger last season and the 2nd best overall pipping the likes of Jack Grealish, Phil Foden, Mahrez, et al. Salah still number 1.
- The top 2 U-23 wingers last season were Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, both of Arsenal. These 2 young men lead Arsenal's title challenge with their scintillating play. Bukayo Saka also earned the young player of the season award for his performances.
- Julio Enciso made a mark in his first season in the PL ranking 3rd for U23s and 7th overall in the season 22-23.
